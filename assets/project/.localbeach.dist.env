# BEACH_FLOW_BASE_CONTEXT=Production
# BEACH_FLOW_SUB_CONTEXT=Instance

# FLOW_CONTEXT=Development/Special

# Change these if your Flow setup is not in the project root
BEACH_FLOW_ROOTPATH=${BEACH_FLOW_ROOTPATH}
BEACH_APPLICATION_PATH=${BEACH_APPLICATION_PATH}

# You may specify additional environment variables below, for example
# a URL of a service you use. Make sure to add this variable to the
# "environment" section of the "php" container in ".localbeach.docker-compose.yaml".
# like so: MY_CUSTOM_VAR=${MY_CUSTOM_VAR}
